What is an Anchor Tag?
It is a tag that is used to create hyperlinks that allow users to navigate from one page to another.

Attributes of Anchor Tag

href: It is used to specify the URL of the page to which you want to link. It can be a web page, an image, an email address, a video, etc.

target: It is used to specify where the linked document will open. It can be _blank, _self, _parent, _top, or framename.

_blank: It opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
_self: It opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default).

title: It is used to specify extra information about the link. It is displayed as a tooltip when the user moves the mouse over the link.

download: It is used to download the linked document. It specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink.


Three Types of Hyperlinks:
    1. Unvisited Link: it is a link that has not been clicked yet. (Blue)
    2. Visited Link: it is a link that has been clicked. (Purple)
    3. Active Link: it is a link that is currently being clicked. (Red)
