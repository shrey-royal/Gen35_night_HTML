Audio Tag: 
    - The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.
    - The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. 
        (it supports 3 types: mp3, wav, ogg)
    - The browser will choose the first source it supports.
    - The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.

    attributes:
        - autoplay: Specifies that the audio will start playing as soon as it is ready
        - controls: Specifies that audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button etc)
        - loop: Specifies that the audio will start over again, every time it is finished
        - muted: Specifies that the audio output should be muted
        - preload: Specifies if and how the author thinks the audio should be loaded when the page loads
        - src: Specifies the URL of the audio file
        - volume: Specifies the volume of the audio output of the video (from 0.0 to 1.0)

    In source attribute if we add #t=xx at the end of the link then it will start playing from xxth second.

    And if we add #t=xx,yy then it will start playing from xxth second and end at yyth second.

WAV, OGG, and MP3 are three different audio file formats, each with its own characteristics and uses. Here's a tabular difference to compare these formats:

| Feature         | WAV (Waveform Audio File Format) | OGG (Ogg Vorbis) | MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Lossless/Lossy  | Lossless                        | Lossy           | Lossy                      |
| Compression     | Uncompressed                    | Compressed      | Compressed                 |
| Sound Quality   | High (Lossless)                 | Good (Lossy)    | Good (Lossy)               |
| File Size       | Large                           | Small to Medium | Small to Medium            |
| Compatibility   | Widely Supported                | Some Support    | Widely Supported           |
| Licensing       | No Licensing Required           | Open Source     | Requires Licensing         |
| Quality Loss    | None                            | Yes             | Yes                        |
| Popular Uses    | Professional Recording, Mastering | Online Streaming, Gaming | Online Streaming, Portable Devices |
| Metadata Support | Yes                           | Limited         | Yes                        |

Explanation:

1. Lossless/Lossy: WAV is a lossless format, meaning it preserves all the original audio data without any quality loss. OGG and MP3 are lossy formats, which means they achieve compression by removing some audio data, resulting in a slight loss of sound quality.

2. Compression: WAV files are uncompressed, which means they retain all the audio data, resulting in larger file sizes. OGG and MP3 are compressed formats, allowing for significantly smaller file sizes at the cost of some audio quality.

3. Sound Quality: WAV files offer the highest sound quality since they are lossless. OGG and MP3 have good sound quality, but it may not be as pristine as the original WAV.

4. File Size: WAV files tend to be much larger compared to OGG and MP3, making them less suitable for online streaming and portable devices with limited storage.

5. Compatibility: WAV is widely supported across various platforms and media players. OGG is supported by most modern devices and media players, but its support might be limited on some older systems. MP3 is one of the most widely supported audio formats.

6. Licensing: WAV is free to use and doesn't require any licensing. OGG is an open-source format, which means it's free to use as well. MP3, however, requires licensing fees for use in certain applications.

7. Quality Loss: WAV files have no quality loss, while OGG and MP3 undergo lossy compression, resulting in some loss of audio quality.

8. Popular Uses: WAV is commonly used in professional audio recording and mastering due to its lossless quality. OGG is often used for online streaming, gaming, and other applications where file size matters. MP3 is widely used for online streaming and portable audio devices due to its small file size.

9. Metadata Support: WAV and MP3 formats support metadata, allowing information like artist, album, and track details to be stored within the file. OGG supports limited metadata compared to MP3.
