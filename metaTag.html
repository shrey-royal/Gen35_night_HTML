What are Meta Tags:
> Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a page's content; the meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's code. We all know tags from blog culture, and meta tags are more or less the same thing, little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.

> The only difference between tags you can see (on a blogpost, say) and tags you can't see is location: meta tags only exist in HTML, usually at the "head" of the page, and so are only visible to search engines (and people who know where to look). The "meta" stands for "metadata," which is the kind of data these tags provide - data about the data on your page.

> Meta tags have several uses:
    1. Meta tags are used by search engines to help index and to provide relevant content in their search results.
    2. They are also used by browsers (such as Firefox and Internet Explorer), email and web feed clients, and other software reading or interpreting web content for display.
    3. Meta tags can be used to provide information to all sorts of clients, and each system processes only the meta tags they understand and ignores the rest.
    4. Meta tags are added to the HTML or XHTML document, but are not directly visible to a user looking at the site. Instead, the meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document.
    5. Meta tags are placed in the <head> section of an HTML or XHTML document.

Meta Tags:

1. charset -> It specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
2. content -> It specifies the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute.
3. http-equiv -> It provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute.
4. name -> It specifies a name for the metadata.
5. scheme -> It specifies a scheme to interpret the value of the content attribute.
6. keywords -> It specifies a comma-separated list of keywords - relevant to the page (Informs search engines what the page is about).
7. description -> It specifies a short and accurate summary of the content of the page (Informs search engines what the page is about).
8. author -> It specifies the name of the page's author.
9. viewport -> It gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
10. robots -> It specifies whether search engines should index the page or follow the links in the page.
11. refresh -> It specifies a time interval for the page to refresh itself.

scheme is used to specify the type of data in the content attribute.

meta tags are used for search engine and browser so that they can understand the content of the page.
